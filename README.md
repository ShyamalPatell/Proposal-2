Gada Electronics  
## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that lets you buy and sell stocks.")

This is a app that lets you buy electrioncs and you can also view cart, place an order, and discounts. 

## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?

The project I developed is an intuitive and user-friendly shopping cart application designed to streamline the online shopping experience. The software allows users to effortlessly browse through a variety of products, add them to their cart, and view the contents at any time. An added feature is the ability to apply a discount code, specifically "FINAL," which grants users a 10% discount on their total purchase, enhancing the overall shopping affordability. To personalize the experience, users have the option to create an account, facilitating easy sign-up and sign-in processes. This account feature not only ensures a secure and tailored shopping journey but also enables users to keep track of their order history. Once satisfied with their selections, users can seamlessly proceed to place an order, making the entire shopping process efficient and enjoyable. 

## If planning to combine 1051's final project with another course's final project, with which other course? And which aspect(s) of your proposed project would relate to 1051, and which aspect(s) would relate to the other course?

TODO, if applicable

## If planning to collaborate with 1 or 2 classmates for the final project, list their names, email addresses, and the names of their assigned TAs below.

TODO, if applicable

## In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.

The primary goal is to ensure that users can successfully complete the checkout process after placing an order, including the seamless application of the discount code "FINAL" for a 10% discount on their purchase.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?

A better outcome for the final project would involve not only enabling users to successfully check out but also implementing a user-friendly sign-up process, ensuring the discount code "FINAL" functions seamlessly, and incorporating a confirmation order step for a comprehensive and satisfying user experience.

The best outcome for the final project would involve successfully achieving all the goals, including implementing a smooth checkout process, ensuring the proper functionality of the discount code, incorporating order history and user sign-in/sign-up features, implementing a confirmation order step, creating a distinctive company logo, and introducing a diverse range of product categories for an enhanced and comprehensive shopping platform.

## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research? If working with one of two classmates, who will do what?

The nex steps would be to make the order history part where the user can see the time and date of the order. I would need to reserch on how I can make it real time and real date.
